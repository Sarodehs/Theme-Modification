    <h5> <span style="font-size: small; color:#ffffff;text-align: center;">What is MUSIC</span></h5>
    <blockquote>Sounds are all around us, from birds chirping and waves lapping against a coastline to cars honking in traffic. But sometimes sounds are put together in purposeful ways to create a specific atmosphere or to express ideas or emotions. Such organized sounds are called music.</blockquote>
    <p><img class="imgleft" src="images/image002.jpg" alt="box" width="100px" height="100px"/>Music is made of sounds, vibrations, and silent moments, and it doesn't always have to be pleasant or pretty. It can be used to convey a whole range of experiences, environments, and emotions.</p>
    <p>Almost every human culture has a tradition of making music. Examples of early instruments like flutes and drums have been found dating back thousands of years. Ancient Egyptians used music in religious ceremonies.</p>
    <p>Many other African cultures have traditions related to drumming for important rituals. Today, rock and pop musicians tour and perform around the world, singing the songs that made them famous. All of these are examples of music.</p>

        <p>I think music in itself is healing American musician Billy Joel once said. Its an explosive expression of humanity. Its something we are all touched by. No matter what culture we are from everyone loves music. Most of us would wholeheartedly agree with this statement and it is this universal bond with music that has led researchers across the globe to investigate its therapeutic potential.</p>

         <p>Music impacts us in ways that other sounds do not and for years now scientists have been wondering why. Now they are finally beginning to find some answers. Using fMRI technology they are discovering why music can inspire such strong feelings and bind us so tightly to other people. Music affects deep emotional centers in the brain says Valorie Salimpoor a neuroscientist at McGill University who studies the brain on music. </p>
